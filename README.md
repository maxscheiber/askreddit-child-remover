This Chrome extension hides by default any child comments on AskReddit. You, of
course, have the option to unhide any specific comment.

I personally like reading top-level responses to AskReddit threads, but I find
the replies to be generally not funny. I'd rather read the thread without seeing
attempts at puns, completions of song lyrics, or on-purpose misunderstandings of
grammatical ambiguities. Those fill-in-the-blank attempts at template humor are
no longer funny to me.
